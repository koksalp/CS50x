# Problem Set: 
This branch includes 3 problems

Both problems require writing SQL queries for solutions. Both folders have one database and a txt file with multiple questions in it. The folder named movies have no database because the size of the file exceeds the upload limit of github . It is a database that is 64 MB in size that stores data from IMDb about movies, the people who directed and starred in them, and their ratings. All the files that have sql extension are SQL queries for answers. 

Note: I have written all the SQL queries long time ago when I was learning SQL and databases, therefore they are both one line queries which makes it really hard to read but I did not waste my time reorganizing them
